;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 16))
;;      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 16))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
;;(setq doom-theme 'doom-Iosvkem)

(setq current-theme-phase 'light)
(load-theme 'doom-one-light)

(defun toggle-theme-phase ()
  "Switch between light and dark themes."
  (interactive)
  (if (eq current-theme-phase 'light)
      (progn
        (setq current-theme-phase 'dark)
        (load-theme 'doom-one))
    (progn
      (setq current-theme-phase 'light)
      (load-theme 'doom-one-light))))

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/org/")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)


;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; to get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'k' (non-evil users must press 'c-c c k').
;; this will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; you can also try 'gd' (or 'c-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.
